								<p>
									For my final project, I decided to create it on the topic of artificial intelligence, because AI has always been an interest of mine.
									I learned a lot about AI from this project, particuarly things that I did not even know were part of the field of AI. It also gave me good insight on things that currently use AI, as well as what the future may have to offer.
									<br>
									<br>
									A big thing that I focused on for this project was my target audience. My purpose was to inform a broad audience about AI, and so I believe that the most accessible and welcoming medium would be a booklet.
									To aid in this, here are some concepts that I applied:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Having a very specific title so the reader knows exactly what the booklet covers about AI.</li>
									<li>Keeping my explanations relatively simple, for ease of understanding.</li>
									<li>Bolding key terms so that readers who only want to skim can see the key points/ideas.</li>
									<li>Including images on nearly every page (also to keep the interest for skimmers).</li>
									<li>Using a relatively casual tone—nothing too formal—again to make a casual reader feel more welcome in reading my booklet.</li>
									<li>As a follow-up to the previous point, not using in-line citations or direct quotes from my sources to keep a casual reader engaged.</li>
									<li>Maintaining a header on almost every page.</li>
								</ul>
